### Features of application

* Application Fetches News Headlines details when app is initialized based on the selected Category
* Styled-Components library are used to create the components-level styles.
* Responsive UI for all kind of device
* A searchBar is created to get the search result of news headlines
* Hide functionality to remove the news card from the user's view
* Like functionality to like any news article
* ALL MODIFIED DATA like hide and likes â€“ should be persisted and should not reset on browser refresh


### Development Approach

* Used Functional Components with Hooks
* Redux is used to maintain single source of truth and persistence of likes and hide articles is made in the store itself.
* Sending API calls ony when topic changes
* Used React lazy and Suspense for code spliting on component level with dynamic imports

### Performance optimization

* lazy loading of Images implemented for each news article
* Memoiztion of Components added, 
* Avoided unncessary API call by saving news for the same topic in localstorage.
* Virtualization of articles card added to avoid creation of unnecessary dom-nodes in dom-node-tree.
